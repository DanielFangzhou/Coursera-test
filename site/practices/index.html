        The CC-01's highly reliable and efficient full-time 4WD system features a longitudinally-positioned motor, which transmits power to the front wheels via the gearbox and to the rear wheels via propeller shaft with universal joints. Front and rear differentials enable smooth cornering, and for even greater off-road performance on rough terrain, the rear differential may be locked during assembly. The chassis suspension employs double-wishbone front upper single links and lower H-shaped arms plus rear rigid suspension. With CVA oil dampers front and rear, there's enough cushion to take on even the roughest surfaces.    </p>

    <h3>CC02</h3>
    <p>
        The Mercedes-Benz G Classâ€™ heavy duty chassis and distinctive body design have long made it a favorite with consumers, and in 2018 it was endowed with new models including the G 500, powered by a 4-liter V8 twin turbo engine. This R/C model assembly kit recreates the G 500. Length: 455mm, width: 196mm, height: 207mm. The boxy form is recreated accurately in polycarbonate, with separate molded parts for front grille, side mirrors and spare tire cover. The CC-02 provides a great base for the model, at home on a range of off-road surfaces and even rocky terrain.

        <h3>CR01</h3>
        <p>
            The Toyota Land Cruiser 40 was produced from 1960 to 1984 and is one of the most well-known 4x4 vehicles in the world. Tamiya has reproduced this classic off-roader as an assembly kit R/C model on the newly developed CR-01 rock crawling chassis. This chassis features a tough ladder frame with aluminum side channels and resin crossmembers, 4-link suspension with aluminum rods, a 4WD system with lockable differentials, massive off-road tires with sidewall tread pattern, and dependable beadlock wheels. The body is of course accurately reproduced in durable polycarbonate material, giving fans a superbly capable rock crawler with scale realism.

     As you can see, our heading didn't really do so well. 
    It says, Don't be afraid to be more and there's a whole 
    bunch of words missing here. Well the reason this is 
    going on is because the browser is interpreting this
     left angle bracket as a beginning of a tag. And then 
     it looks at the word then. It doesn't quite understand
      what kind of a tag that is and basically skips just 
      about everything between the left angle bracket and the 
      right angle bracket and just says the word more. So we 
      could fix that very easily with substituting the 
      < angle bracket with  the&nbsp;HTML&nbsp; entity&nbsp; reference.
